The **Image Recognition API** is a powerful tool that uses a pre-trained deep learning model to identify objects, scenes, and more in images. Itâ€™s built with **Flask** and integrates with **SendGrid** for email notifications. Whether you're building an e-commerce platform, a social media app, or an educational tool, this API can help you automate image analysis and enhance user experience.

## Features

- **Accurate Predictions**: Identify objects, scenes, and more with high accuracy using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple RESTful API endpoints for seamless integration into your applications.
- **Email Notifications**: Send confirmation emails to users using SendGrid.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle thousands of requests per second.
- **Privacy-First**: Includes a privacy policy to ensure user data is protected.

## How It Works

1. **Upload an Image**: Users upload an image to the API.
2. **Analyze the Image**: The API processes the image using a deep learning model.
3. **Return Predictions**: The API returns the top predictions with confidence scores.
4. **Send Confirmation**: Optionally, send a confirmation email to the user.
